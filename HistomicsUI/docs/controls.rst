    of 2.  If shift+ctrl is held down, they zoom the image by 1/4th of a power
    of 2.

  - **1 - 7**: The number keys 1 - 7 will zoom to discrete zoom levels.  1

Annotation Controls
-------------------

- **Show / hide all annotations**:

  - **a**: If any annotations are not visible, show all annotations.  If all
    annotations are being shown, hide all annotations.

- **Select annotation**:

  - **Right click**: right clicking on an annotation element will show a
    context menu allowing the annotation element's style group to be changed,
    or to edit its shape or properties, or to delete it.  If more than one
    element is selected, the context menu will be applied to all selected
    elements.

  - **m**: Show the context menu for the currently selected annotations, if
    any.  If no annotations are selected, show the context menu for the
    annotation under the mouse cursor.

  - **s**: Switch to area select mode.  Left-drag a rectangle around a group of
    annotation elements to select them.

  - **S**: Switch to area select polygon mode.  Draw a polygon around a group of
    annotation elements to select them.

  - **C**: Clear current selection.

  - **Ctrl-left click**: toggle whether an individual annotation element is
    selected.

- **New annotation**:

  - **space**: Show the new annotation dialog.  This is the same as clicking
    the "New" button.

- **Draw an annotation element**:

  - **o**, **r**, **i**, **c**, **p**, **l**, **b**: Switch to point,
    rectangle, ellipse, circle, polygon, line, or brush drawing mode.  If
    already in that mode, turn off drawing mode.

    - **shift**: When drawing a rectangle or an ellipse, after starting to draw
      it, holding down shift will adjust it to a square or circle.

  - **enter**: While drawing a line or polygon annotation element, finish
    drawing, closing the polygon or terminating the line.

  - **esc**: Cancel drawing an annotation element.

- **Edit / modify annotation shape**:

  - **e**: While the mouse is over the annotation element, typing e will put it
    in edit mode.  This is the same as selecting "Edit Shape" from the context
    menu.

  - **shift**: When drawing an annotation element with area (e.g., all but
    points and lines), switch to **Add** mode.  This needs to be held down when
    the annotation is started (the first point in a polygon, rectangle, etc.).
    When the annotation element is finished, it will be combined with any
    existing elements in the same annotation document and the same style group.
